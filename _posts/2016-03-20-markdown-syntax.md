So you graduate from a coding bootcamp. 6 months later and they pump out of the nerd-farm into a real world. Most of your classmates have already been hired, and you haunt the code school building like an unemployed ghost while the first flakes of snow fall against a charcoal colored sky. What do you do?

You build your first jekyll site.
