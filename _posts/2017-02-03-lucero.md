I just wanted to draw some attention to this wonderful tune: it is a Jawbreaker cover, and I remember once seeing Lucero at the Ogden Theater when Ben, singer and main songwriter, said into the mic, "This song is ours now. Jawbreaker finally just gave it to us."
It's a great song originally; Ben and Blake's gritty vocals are comparable in each, and it's very easy to see how a good punk song can easily make a great country one.

I love to compare originals and covers. In this case I daresay I side with the Lucero version; if nothing else, than for the mandolin alone!
