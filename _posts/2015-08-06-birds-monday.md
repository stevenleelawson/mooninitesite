Monday. The dreaded day. The day of excitement! The white milk sky of winter, and the oppressive phosphorus sun. She was coming back from NYC for the holidays, to visit her mother who was turning 60. I had offered my services as a free cab from the airport, and she had accepted.

“This faithful man will be there in his old, tattered van!” I said.

“Oh, thank you, faithful man! See you tomorrow!” she replied. I re-read that telegram over 160 times, each recitation receiving pleasure; my tiny precious artifact from her. I went to bed early with the nervousness of a child before Christmas, knowing that the sooner I went to bed, the sooner I would awake to Santa’s presents! As an adult, my present from Santa was to spend time with the most wonderfully frustrating person that I had ever known.

She had not asked me to be her airport cabbie; I had offered as soon as she mentioned that she had bought a plane ticket back to our native state of Colorado. I wonder now how obvious it was to her that I would drive her wherever and anywhere- I would find a way to drive her to Paris, across the Atlantic, if that’s where she wanted to go. Women often have a way of sensing these things. Like how blind people are only blind in this dimension. Look it up, it’s true.

I had once seen a documentary about the mating habits of the exotic birds of paradise. The males, in addition to showcasing vibrant plumage, would spend days reading a stage (or love nest) on which to display their candidacy as a mate. In much the same way, I cleaned my apartment, and similarly turned my birdy diligence towards readying the chariot that would ferry the object of my affection from the airport. This mostly consisted of ridding my van of empty beer bottles and cigarette packs, but nothing was left to chance! Before the quarter-fed vacuum and spray wash, I made a stop at the Tibetan gift shop and purchased two kinds of incense to perfume my van with; Sandalwood and Indian Temple. Coughing from lighting both in the confined space of my locomotive, I hazarded the big trucks of the industrial part of town and entered the freeway to the airport.

I was running late due to my bird of paradise schtick, and in a hurried zooming between cars on the highway, my mobile device on the passenger seat lit up. I knew it had to be her, and with the wind roaring in my ear and the incense burning, I answered.

“Hello!” I said.

“Hi! My plane just got in, and I’m in the terminal. I was not ready at all for all the Christmas sweaters! There are so many people wearing them, in red and green; I was not prepared for this!!”

“Run! Hide from them!” I said. “My van is a Christmas-Free Zone. You are safe here.” The raging wind blowing in through my driver-side window obstructed my attempt at humor.

“What?!”

“Nevermind. I’ll see you very soon!” We exchanged the pertinent navigational information, and I speeded with urgency towards the terminal.

Pulling into the concrete cave, I saw her there. In tight jeans and boots, she was even prettier than my imagination had prepared me for. She recognized her sloppy knight, and I waved to her like a dork. I unlocked the passenger door, and she fumbled her two over-stuffed backpacks into the vehicle. Her auburn hair spilled playfully onto her shoulders. Her bright amber eyes regarded me. Her smile lit a fire in the lighthouse of my heart, and she thanked me for picking her up.

Now, you have to understand, as I envisioned this very scenario the night before, I foresaw a much smoother, non-existent version of me to respond in a way that would make even James Bond jealous of my mastery of seduction. She would say:

“How can I ever thank you?!” and I would reply, with ultimate smoothness:

“I think a kiss from you might do the trick.” Of course, she did not say that, and my reaction was one of typical nice-guy blandness. We exchanged pleasantries, and exited the concrete cave of the arrivals. The James Bond inside my head laughed his ass off.

“I did not sleep last night,” she said. “It’s so BRIGHT here, especially painful when hungover.

“I know- it’s just the worst. Makes me long so badly for the dim, gloomy skies of the northwest.” I drove on, trying to look as desirable as I could with my two sets of glasses; sun-over-visioncorrection. I said helpfully, “ I think there is an extra pair of sunglasses on the back seat, if you want to use them.”

“Oh! That’s great! Thank you!” She put on the sunglasses that I had gotten for free from somewhere, and continued. “So, all I want is enough money for a bungalow here, and a house in Paris, so I think I have my million-dollar idea: People like reality shows, right?”

“The populace seems to, yes. Although it’s such a bizarre thing to me, because the producers set up these dramatic scenarios that are a fake ‘reality.’ I must admit, though, that I enjoy a reality show about people haggling over rare comic books!!” I said, smooth as fucking ever.

“Well, here’s my idea. It’s a cooking show with second-generation immigrants cooking with their parents. They cook an ethnic meal together, and the audience gets a reality program AND a cooking show!”

I considered this and said, “You need a catchy title. The executives will insist on having the perfect-attention-capturing-title for the show. What have you got?”

“I’m thinking about calling it ‘Relative Kitchens…”

“Like a pun, right? Wait, that doesn’t make any sense (!!?is that technically a pun?!! I wondered).” I laughed nervously and then said, “Would you be Executive Producer: Camilya Dofor?!”

“Ideally,” she said as she took a drag from her cigaret, “I would sell the idea for 125; I was going to say thousand. 125…million!! That should be enough for my bungalow, right?”

“Well, this is your baby, so you might want to produce the first episodes, at least.”

“Maybe we could do it together!” The notion that I might be somewhere in this woman’s future elated me, and filled me with delight. She went on:

“But it has to have DRAMA, right? My solution is this; when Enrico finds out that his brother slept with his wife, there will be a HUGE blow-up, and then the producers will take everyone to McDonalds.” Camilya had thought of everything. I marveled at her.

I told her about my dreams. To go to LA, for only as long as necessary to make a reputation, then to build a recording studio in the middle of nowhere; my own misanthropic heaven: GIT OFT MY LAND!! I would say, rifle in the crook of my arm. I said, “I’ve decided to live at my parent’s cabin for the last half of January…” A light bulb, or possibly an exclamation mark lit up above her head in the passenger seat.

“I’ll be here for the entire month of January…” she said.

I bit.

I stuttered, “You could come with me…”

I looked over at her. She was staring straight ahead, wearing my green sunglasses, smiling innocently but kind of oddly–

**TO THE CHRIST I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN: PLEASE TELL ME that she was aware of what that might imply. AMEN. May you go to the heaven, Sweet Zombie Jesus, of the Walking Dead. Sorry bearded god**

Through a suburban labyrinth she guided me, to her mother’s house. Meeting parents of ANYONE is rarely a pleasant experience; and I was understandably somewhat nervous. Her mother Evita ran a daycare in her home to pay the bills. I was to be fed Hungarian food and talk to children.

After informing my hostesses that I have been a vegetarian for the last 17 years, I was given a fare of spinach and garlic “soup.” It wasn’t so much a soup as a puree; not unlike warm hummus, I suppose. It was topped with a sliced hard-boiled egg with a side of pretzel bread. Camilya microwaved and served it to me, with the children screaming outside. The food was quite good.

Most of the children die kinder, entrusted to Mrs. Dofor (during the afternoons of weekdays) would repeatedly hit each other with plastic trucks and then proceeded to cry about it- this made me fret for the future of the human race. But there was one child, the eldest, who was clearly the superior to her colleagues of the Play Doh, tricycle and the nap; a blonde Jewish girl who was very excited about Chanukah. I bent down and said, either very charmingly or very offensively, “You know, lil’ gal, that when I was your age, I was always very jealous of my Jewish friends who got so many much more awesome presents than I did. Come to think of it, they were very rich, though.” Much like people rather older than her, she had no idea how to respond to me. Camilya either smiled or winced at my remark, standing by the trashcan and the sliding glass door. I laughed nervously again, and scooped a bit of the garlic-spinach puree with the pretzel bread, with a wedge bit of hard-boiled egg along for the ride. Outside, the children committed minor physical assaults on each other and continued to cry more about it. It was then time to have my interview with the mother.

“So,” in a very heavy accent her mother said,” Did you like the food?”

“Oh, yes. It was very good, but I like things spicy, so I asked Camilya for some hot sauce.”

Camilya spoke something softly to her mother that was unintelligible to me; most likely because I did not speak Hungarian. Her mother’s eyes shined a burst of understanding with a nod and a smile of recognition. She turned to me and said, “Ah-yes! The Hungarian paprika!”

“Some like it hot, right? Like Marilyn Monroe?!” This flew through the air like a drunk javelin. Camilya’s mother pivoted, and asked the most pertinent question.

“So what do you do?” she asked.

“I just got my degree in music. With an emphasis on the recording arts. The only degree more worthless is a philosophy degree.” I was pleased with myself for being so refreshingly honest; so iconoclast.

“Do you have any other skills?” her mother inquired.

“Oh, god no.” I said, still impressed with my frankness. Camilya jumped in to my apparent need of defense:

“He can paint! He told me on the way over that he has been earning some money painting houses.” It occurred to me later that I was in an interview and didn’t even know about it. It was kinda like with a job where the manager asks, “What is your greatest weakness?” Most people would answer by saying something like, “Okay. Here goes: my greatest fault is that I’m a perfectionist.”

But I had effectively said to this employer of the girl I hoped to be with, “I have a distaste for authority and am chronically tardy. I have nothing to offer your daughter other than writing her bad poetry and having stupid tattoos. And I can fake my way on a variety of instruments and also sing sometimes.” Camilya smiled helplessly in my defense. I had no idea what had happened.

(Saying goodbye to you at your mother’s house, we were like a mirror. In unison, an alright in a prelude then a bye in the same pitch. And I admit I missed you instantly. The long drive through the strip mall plains, the complacent gas stations, the sedentary street names; as a crimson sun burnt down the west, behind the cardboard mountains. And then a tiny bird in my heart began the sweetest melody. I could not help but to relive every second I had alone with you. On the porch, in the backyard. The sheen of auburn in your hair. The curve and pattern of your lips. The sweet timbre of your voice. The quick elegance of your mind. It was entirely too much beauty for one man to witness.)

The next month for me was unbearable. I struggled my way through Christmas. Being at my parents’ house for the holidays I would stay up late after everyone had gone to bed, I would go out to the hot tub and look at the stars and wonder: Could I have found happiness, at long last? Would we have a house in California or Paris, with a dog that I would name Winston? Winston for Lennon and Churchill. Oh, and what would we name our kids? Fiona if a girl, Wolfgang if a boy. Stuck in this agonizing loop, I rarely had a moment of peace because I was always thinking about her. The stars stared down at me indifferently.

She was supposed to return from her trip with her mother on New Years Eve, so on New Years Day, I sat in front of my phone, willing it to ring with only the power of my mind. And then have it be her the other end of the line, as excited to see me as I was to see her. Whenever the phone rang and it was not Camilya, I found myself vexed at the caller: how dare you attempt to communicate with me and not be she! It went on like this for days, but I had resolved myself to wait for her to call, so as to not seem desperate. This had come from all the previous failed scenarios with women over the years, and I vowed to not make the same mistake. I am an unlucky gambler who is impulsive, and it has rarely served me well in matters of romance. Or really in anything, actually.

After the 6th day after her return, I could take it no longer. I sent a telegram that read, “I HAVE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR YOU.” To which she replied,

“Oh really?! What is it?!”

“Don’t you want it to be a surprise?!” I wrote back.

“Okay a surprise then. I’ve got plenty of free time in the next two weeks…”

“Want to kick it tomorrow?” I asked.

“Sure, how does late Monday afternoon sound?”

“Perfekt!” I said.

The next day, I was excited, but had the nagging feeling that something would go wrong with our little date. To distract myself, I went to the grocery store, which is something that I hate, due to my agoraphobia. (And getting caught shop-lifting at grocery stores in my younger days, probably didn’t help). I cleaned my apartment again, Bird of Paradise-style. I went to the liquor store, and bought a big bottle of red wine I thought we could share, while we watched a movie on my bed. Although maybe not the most creative date, it was my idea of a perfect one. Alas, my Spidey-Sense turned out to be correct. She wrote:

“Hey! So I totally forgot that I had plans with my friend Jen, but I was wondering if the three of us could go to the art museum.” I did not respond for a while because I had to examine this like Batman would a crime scene. This did not portend well, for three reasons:

At the last minute, perhaps she had gotten scared and decided to call friend-back-up, which is a classic girl move I had experienced more than once.
I had been planning this little date for weeks, but for her, it was not something she really thought about at all.
The art museum is always closed on Mondays.
I found out the last thing while doing my Dark Knight diligence, and looking up the map, and the hours of operation for the place. I saw on the website: CLOSED MONDAYS. Now, was this an ingenious move of strategy, so there would be no chance of us having the date at all, or was she simply delightfully absent-minded, like Elizabeth Shue’s character in that bad 90s movie, The Saint, where she was a brilliant scientist, but had post-it notes all over her apartment, to remind her to buy milk and such? Camilya asked it there was “anything else,” which I assumed meant another museum of some kind. I did some more research, and found that for some reason, all institutions of this kind are universally closed on Mondays. Another reason to hate them, I suppose. The Mondays. Like the fat cat. I reported this Monday closure and was met with hours of inconsiderate radio silence from her. When I could take it no longer, I wrote her in what I thought was the rational/compassionate way to go about it, “If you just want to hang out with your buddy tonight, I completely understand. You are only back in town for so long, and I’m sure you have a lot of people to see.”

To which she replied, “Going to yoga. Call you when I’m done.” She did not, and I got so depressed, I drank the whole bottle of wine I had bought for the both of us. I went to a bar before last call, and found a stranger to complain to about women.

She finally did call me two days later, after I had finally sobered up, and resolved to not feel sorry for myself. She was apologetic from the first.

“I’m really sorry about the other night.”

“I was a bit disappointed…” I said, to show her that I was no doormat.

“Well, my flight got delayed several days and I was stuck in Costa Rica.” She went on to explain that her train-wreck-drunk-of-a-sister had destroyed the house while her mother and she were vacationing. I assumed this meant she had a party. What had happened, in fact, was that her sister had a vodka-infused-bout-of home-improvement, and sanded all the wood in the house. “The floors?” I asked, confusedly.

“Yup. She power-sanded everything, then just…left.” she clarified. This made me sympathetic, and I quickly forgot about how sad I was on Monday. Goodbye, Blue Monday. We talked a while amicably about her trip. She said she was going to a spa with some friends over the weekend and that she would call me when she got back so we could finally hang out. Just like that, I was back in, and looked forward to her return with glee. Evidently, I am incapable of seeing patterns. She did not call on the following Monday, when she said she would return. Fucking Mondays.

I only got to see her once, the whole month she was here, for about 30 minutes at a coffee shop. I was trying to sell some books there, and she wrote that she would be in the area, so a cup of coffee was arranged.

It was cordial, and we talked about Islamic terrorists murdering cartoonists as well as the atrocity of the blood diamond trade. We smoked a few cigarets, and she said she had to be getting back to her mother. I was also selling the last of my worldy possesions (a collection of compact discs) at the record store down the street. They bought a few of my more rare albums (such as The Point by Nilsson and a deluxe 2 cd set of Pavement’s Crooked Rain). I knew they wouldn’t take everything, and on a whim, I reached into my paper bag of music and said,

“Here, you should have this. It’s one of my favorite records. I discovered Bonnie “Prince” Billy during my ‘On The Road’ period somewhere in Toledo. This album, I See a Darkness, is my favorite of his, because of how raw it is. Listening to it, you can tell it was just recorded in somebody’s house. All of my favorite records are like that.” She offered to pay me a few dollars for it, but I declined. We had a nice friendly hug, and then parted company. I guess that ended up being her Christmas present from me. It wasn’t the love poem I had written for her on a typewriter with her name written on the envelope; it was a scratched, second hand disc of music I would have accepted a dollar for.

That’s where things should have ended neatly. Sporadically for the past three years I had been sending Camilya poems and melodies I had composed just for her, in the hope of her slowly seeing the vast expanse of the imaginative world inside of me. In those three years, I should have realized what time it really was: she enjoyed my company, but that’s where it stopped with her. She did not feel the same way about me. But this is me we are conversing about; I was not to be content until I humiliated myself one more time.

After I gave her the record, we started sending telegrams back and forth. Did you know this nerdy fact about the album; yes it was beautiful I enjoyed it very much. Well, I spent the money I made from selling my compact discs on beer; I hope I will not regret spending that money on getting drunk when I have no money for food in LA. No, you did the right thing; you only eat once a day and you will sell a million songs anyway. You believe in me?! Yes: I’m banking on you to repay my student loans. Heh- I was just going to say that if I make it big, I will buy you that house on the Seine. Now I have it in writing too; you will make it big and then I’ll be after you. But not before? Ha, I meant legally, for my house; but I can sue you now too. Uh, don’t we have to be married first, before you can sue me; guess who’s signing a prenuptial. In America you can sue anybody; I’ll sign that prenuptial when I see that blood diamond! Ok, let me just go to Africa real quick; I will find you the biggest, bloodiest diamond I can find!!! I went to the bar again that night to complain about women to people I did not know.

The next day, I thought I really smart thing to say was, since we’d been joking about marriage:

“You know, if you were my wife, my chief concern every day would be to make you happy.”

That was the last time we spoke, she left without a goodbye.

*                     *                     *                     *                     *                     *

So here I am, in my last days in this town, degree from the University finally in hand. I should be actively moving out of my apartment, but instead I watch too much television, and there are beer cans and empty pizza boxes everywhere; the trash is full, the recycling unmanageable.

One night, while pouring beer on my indigo loneliness and watching television, I came across a documentary about the Eagles. Not the birds or even the Byrds, mind you, but the easy-rock machine of Don Henley and Glenn Frey. It was strange that this piqued my curiosity, because for years I had proclaimed my hatred for their brand of what I called “safety rock.” I had long taken the position that The Dude had in The Big Lebowski, which was of course, “Hey man, I just hate the fucking Eagles.” Take it Easy? Really?! Everyday I find it so extraordinarily difficult; be damned you sellout millionaires! But I had heard about their infamous band drama, and having experienced that myself, albeit on a much less successful level, and I was intrigued with their band story. At one point, modern day sober Joe Walsh said something rather wise and poignant. Which surprised me, having just learned that he was the King of Room-Trash, alongside Keith Moon; attacking their hotel rooms with chainsaws and driving expensive cars into pools. Modern day sober Joe Walsh said, “I was reading this philosopher that said, when things are happening to you, at the time it’s happening, everything seems so chaotic and random. But after many years, when you look back at it, all the things that happened in the past seem more like a finely crafted novel. And that’s what it was like, being in the Eagles.”

Though I will never know what it was like being in the Eagles, this idea stuck with me for the next couple days; The chaos of the present, and the order of the past.
