I've always hated musicals; the music is usually bad, and the near-reality of breaking into song in public is vexing. For a musician, this has always struck me as bizarre; I love movies and I love music-why does this combination annoy me so?

Casting Emma Stone as the lead was a good start. If I was intrigued by her before, I am in love with her now. Her vocal tone is so real and vulnerable; soft and sweet, yet powerful when she wills it. Ryan Gosling is the less strong singer, but his muted baritone comes off as endearing. I'd much prefer a singer like him that's real than some over-the-top bravado.
