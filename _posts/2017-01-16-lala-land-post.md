I've always hated musicals; the music is usually bad, and the near-reality of breaking into song in public is vexing. For a musician, this has always struck me as bizarre; I love movies and I love music-why does this combination annoy me so?

Casting Emma Stone as the lead was a good start. If I was intrigued by her before, I am in love with her now. Her vocal tone is so real and vulnerable; soft and sweet, yet powerful when she wills it. Ryan Gosling is the less strong singer, but his muted baritone comes off as endearing. I'd much prefer a singer like him that's real than some over-the-top bravado.

In December of 2014, I graduated from CU Denver with a Bachelor's of Science in the Recording Arts and Music. That March, I rid myself of most of my earthly possessions, the remainder being music gear. I loaded up my van, Betsy, (that I had purchased years before for touring in my various bands) with a bass, three guitars, microphones, glockenspiel, and mixing board. I headed West from Colorado with my ultimate goal of making it in Los Angeles in the entertainment industry.
