I was quite the gamer as a boy; I had a miserable home situation at the time, and my answer was escapism in the form of a NES, and then later, an SNES. Amidst this perilous time of boyhood, there remain sweet oasees of happy memories in the form of my favorite video games.

What comes to mind first, is Donkey Kong Country, possibly the most visually pleasing video game made for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.
