I never truly understood the blues until I heard Howlin' Wolf for the first time. Sure, as every aspiring guitar player eventually does, I had made my way to the crossroads where Robert Johnson had sold his soul to the devil to play the way he did. I think now, many years later, that if Robert Johnson sold his soul to get that, what in the Hell did Chuck Berry do?!!
I remember I was in my early 20's, and had a guitar teacher by the name of Neil Haverstick. Guy was obsessed with micro-tonal guitars, and wasn't of much help to me, an aspiring cardinal in the Church of Dylan. But he did let me borrow his Howlin' Wolf cd.

This album featured BOTH self-titled Howlin' Wolf, with the picturesque drawing of a guitar resting on an album chair, and "Moanin' in the Moonlight," with it's equally awesome album cover with a wolf howling, that looks like somebody designed it in Microsoft Paint sometime in the 90's.

The true is, both of these amazing albums were both recorded in various Chess sessions, from 1958-1962. I suppose the critics would say it perfectly embodies "Chicago Blues," but to my early-20-something ears, it was the most raw thing that I had ever heard. I had recently discovered Tom Waits, who I still adore, but I acknowledge that Mr. Waits would be nothing without the gravely vocals of Chester Burnett, nearly 30 years before. This is the blues at its most authentic in spirit: it is dirty, raw, back-alley music with electric guitars, piano, harmonica, and of course, the Howl of the Wolf.
