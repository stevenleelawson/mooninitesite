This is my new girlfriend:

I love the dryness of this tune two-fold: the dryness of the recording quality itself, and the arid nonchalance of the lyrics. The choice to have her yelling through a Mercedes sunroof, being drug across an abandoned roller rink, and general sassy attitude work really well in a song that is part Blondie, Patty Smith and PJ Harvery.
