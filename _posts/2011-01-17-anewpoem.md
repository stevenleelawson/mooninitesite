after spending several lifetimes alone in that desolate lighthouse, I think I could live inside the moon with you. inside of me, the tired old Mandolin began to make music again. We have become Masters of the Seasons, summoning a spring rain or Red leaves with a single emotion. Because you Are, the shadows on the wall of the cave are given form and substance. My dreams have become beautiful again. Magic has returned to the night air-there is lavender, oranges and tea for whoever desires it! I hope this Wonderful Arson will catch fire to your heart, and we will never know a cold night again.
