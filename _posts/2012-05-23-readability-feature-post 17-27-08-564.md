BIG STAR was an incredible rock band from the '70s, but peculiarly, no one has ever heard of them. You know the opening song to "That 70s Show"? Big Star wrote it. On the show it is covered by Bad Finger. To truly dig the Big Star story, we have to get to know two young men: Alex Chilton and Chris Bell.
