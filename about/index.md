Obsessed with design from an early age, I got into web development to combine my love a of well-designed experience (UI and UX), with the functionality of being able to turn it into living and breathing code. I call this being a creative front end developer, and I am proficient in the MEAN stack with an emphasis on Angular, as well as being proficient at Adobe Illustrator CC and Adobe Photoshop CC.

I know I am just starting my new career, having been a musician in my previous life, but I am a natural problem solver, eager to learn, and can bring unique creative talents to the table.

In addition to creating intriguing web apps, I love to play the piano and guitar, write original songs, compose poetry, and one day (hopefully) write the great american novel.
