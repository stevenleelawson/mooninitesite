Born and bred in Denver, Colorado, I am a full stack web developer, and a student of the Galvanize Web Development Immersive program. My core stack is: JavaScript, SQL, Node.js, Git, Angular, Knex.js, TDD, HTML/CSS and the Agile Methodologies.

I am a natural team builder and organizer from 10 years of creating bands, booking tours, scheduling recording and producing sessions; I am affable and love to tell programming jokes, and work naturally in a team.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Music, with an emphasis on the Recording Arts in 2014 from the University of Colorado at Denver, which trained me in using multiple DAWs (digital audio workstations) and recording software. Learning how to use recording software made me curious about other possible careers in technology, so I enrolled and graduated from Galvanize, and now I'm looking for a first "gig" in my new field.

In addition to creating intriguing web apps, I love to play the piano and guitar, write original songs, compose poetry, and one day (hopefully) write the great american novel.
